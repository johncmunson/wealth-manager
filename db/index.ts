/**
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DB INITIALIZATION STRATEGY
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This module creates or reuses a pg Pool, creates a fresh Drizzle wrapper for
 * the current module instance, and exports both.
 *
 * It has runtime branches keyed by standard NODE_ENV values: development,
 * test, and production. Staging is not a NODE_ENV value; staging deploys run
 * with NODE_ENV=production and APP_ENV=staging, so they receive the same
 * database client behavior as production.
 *
 * 1) DEVELOPMENT (Next.js dev server)
 *    - HMR reloads modules on file changes. Without care, each reload would
 *      create a new Pool (and new DB connections), quickly exhausting the DB.
 *    - In development, we store the Pool on globalThis so module reloads reuse
 *      connections.
 *    - We still create a fresh Drizzle wrapper per module instance so schema-
 *      derived caches do not survive HMR reloads.
 *
 * 2) TEST (automated tests)
 *    - NODE_ENV is typically "test".
 *    - Tests use the same Pool cache as local development and skip the Vercel
 *      Fluid cleanup hook.
 *    - Ensure DATABASE_URL points at a dedicated test database when tests run.
 *
 * 3) PRODUCTION / STAGING (deployed app on Vercel Fluid Compute)
 *    - Modules do not hot-reload. Each instance holds one Pool in memory.
 *    - We call attachDatabasePool(pool) so Fluid can close idle clients cleanly
 *      before the instance is suspended, preventing "leaked" connections.
 *
 * Pool sizing:
 *  - max:   modest numbers (10 in production/staging, 5 elsewhere) to avoid stampeding
 *           the DB, yet allow concurrency per instance.
 *  - idleTimeoutMillis:
 *           short (5s in production/staging, 1s in development/test) so unused clients
 *           are recycled quickly; this works well with Fluid's lifecycle + the
 *           attach helper.
 *
 * Client-side pooling + a provider pooler:
 *  - Using a pg Pool on the client side **and** a provider pooled endpoint from
 *    Neon is safe here because:
 *      a) We always release clients back to the app pool promptly.
 *      b) In production, Fluid's attachDatabasePool ensures idle clients are
 *         closed before suspension (so no lingering "leaks").
 *  - This pattern is portable to other Postgres providers (e.g., RDS). If you
 *    switch later, you typically just swap DATABASE_URL.
 *
 * Drizzle casing: { casing: "snake_case" }
 *  - Maps JS identifiers to SQL names in snake_case (e.g., `createdAt` -> `created_at`)
 *    so your TypeScript objects can stay idiomatic while the DB uses conventional
 *    snake_case columns/tables.

 * - idleTimeoutMillis:
 *   - production/staging: 5000 ms -> short enough to free idle clients quickly (good for
 *     elasticity) but long enough to allow rapid reuse under bursty traffic.
 *   - development/test: 1000 ms -> quick recycle during local runs; keeps things
 *     snappy and avoids connection accumulation during frequent restarts.

 * Note: These are sensible defaults, not absolutes. Monitor and tune as needed.

 *
 * Do not cache this wrapper across local module reloads. Drizzle keeps an

 * - Code stays the same. Swap DATABASE_URL to point at your new Postgres host.
 * - If you used a provider pooled URL, another provider may not have that notion;
 *   either:
 *     - use the provider directly (often fine at modest scale), or
